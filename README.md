# ComfyUI_Example_Area_Composition
This ComfyUI nodes setup demonstrates how the conditioning mechanism functions. It stitches together an AI-generated horizontal panorama of a landscape depicting different seasons. The example is based on the original modular interface sample found in ComfyUI_examples -> Area Composition Examples: https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/area_composition/.
You can utilize it for your custom panoramas. Simply drag and drop the image into your ComfyUI interface window to load the nodes, modify some prompts, press "Queue Prompt," and wait for the AI generation to complete.
This example is accompanied by a detailed explanatory illustration in my YouTube video.
