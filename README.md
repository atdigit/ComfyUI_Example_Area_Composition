# ComfyUI_Example_Area_Composition

Examples below are accompanied by a [tutorial in my YouTube video](https://youtu.be/c54HtMDZ_X4).

This ComfyUI node setup demonstrates how the Stable Diffusion conditioning mechanism functions. It stitches together an AI-generated horizontal panorama of a landscape depicting different seasons. The example is based on the original modular interface sample found in [ComfyUI_examples -> Area Composition Examples](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/area_composition/).

You can utilize it for your custom panoramas. Simply drag and drop the image into your [ComfyUI interface window](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) to load the nodes, modify some prompts, press "Queue Prompt," and wait for the AI generation to complete. Stable Diffusion model used in this demonstration is [Lyriel](https://civitai.com/models/22922/lyriel?modelVersionId=72396).

Video tutorial on how to use ComfyUI, a powerful and modular Stable Diffusion GUI and backend, is [here](https://youtu.be/Ij8k6mBgL3o).
